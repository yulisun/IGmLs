# IGmLs

IGmLs for Heterogeneous Change Detection with Unregistered Images. This work is currently under review.

![示例图片](/example.png)

An example of HCD with unregistered images. (a) and (b) correspond to the pre- and post-change images, where exists a registration error of 6 pixels each horizontally and vertically in the first row, and a registration error of $3^{\circ}$ rotation in the second row. (c)-(d) correspond to the detection results generated by SCASC and the proposed IGmLs, respectively. In the change map, white, red, black, and cyan mark true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN), respectively.
